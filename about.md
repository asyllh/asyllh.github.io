I'm currently a Mathematics PhD student at Cardiff University, working with [Dr Rhydian Lewis](http://www.rhydlewis.eu) and [Dr Jonathan Thompson](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98669-thompson-jonathan) on the Score-Constrained Strip-Packing Problem (SCSPP), a topic combining strip packing and cutting stock problems using graph theory.

I have an extensive range of work experience over various sectors, including accounting, medicine, public relations, property and retail. For a comprehensive overview of my work experience, take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asylhawa/) profile.

If I'm not working, I'm most probably reading. You can keep up to date with books I'm currently enjoying on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27300675-asyl).

All of my work is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/asyllh), and is updated regularly.
