I'm currently a Research Fellow at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/index.page) (Southampton Business School), working alongside [Dr Carlos Lamas-Fernández](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/clf1v16.page), [Dr Antonio Martinez-Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/departments/decision-analytics-and-risk/staff/am1u10.page), and [Dr Christine Currie](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/ccurrie.page). [ESRC](https://esrc.ukri.org/) Impact Acceleration Account project “Increasing productivity in the domiciliary care sector through automated routing and scheduling of carers”. 

I finished my PhD in Mathematics at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/477837-hawa-asyl) in 2020, where I worked with [Dr Rhyd Lewis](http://www.rhydlewis.eu) and [Dr Jonathan Thompson](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98669-thompson-jonathan) on the Score-Constrained Packing Problem (SCPP), a topic combining bin packing and cutting stock problems using graph theory.

I have an extensive range of work experience over various sectors, including accounting, medicine, public relations, property and retail. For a comprehensive overview of my work experience, take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asylhawa/) profile.

When I'm not working, I'm usually either running or reading. You can keep up to date with books I'm currently enjoying on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27300675-asyl).

All of my work is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/asyllh), and is updated regularly. I also have work published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=asyl%20hawa&type=software) which corresponds to work in my thesis.

If you'd like to chat or would just like more information, please do not hesistate to contact me by email or on LinkedIn.
