I'm currently a Mathematics PhD student at Cardiff University, working with [Dr Rhydian Lewis](http://www.rhydlewis.eu) and [Dr Jonathan Thompson](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98669-thompson-jonathan) on a topic combining bin packing and cutting stock problems called The Minimum Score Separation Problem. This thesis topic is an extension of research by [Dr Kai Becker](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/beckerkaidr) - you can take a look at his original work [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Fjors.2014.87).

If I'm not working, I'm most probably reading. You can keep up to date with books I'm currently enjoying on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27300675-asyl).

For a comprehensive overview of my work experience, take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asylhawa/) profile.

All of my work is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/asyllh), and is updated regularly.
