I'm currently finishing my PhD in Mathematics at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/477837-hawa-asyl), where I have worked with [Dr Rhydian Lewis](http://www.rhydlewis.eu) and [Dr Jonathan Thompson](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98669-thompson-jonathan) on the Score-Constrained Packing Problem (SCPP), a topic combining bin packing and cutting stock problems using graph theory.

I have an extensive range of work experience over various sectors, including accounting, medicine, public relations, property and retail. For a comprehensive overview of my work experience, take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asylhawa/) profile.

When I'm not working, I'm usually either running or reading. You can keep up to date with books I'm currently enjoying on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27300675-asyl).

All of my work is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/asyllh), and is updated regularly. I also have work published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=asyl%20hawa&type=software) which corresponds to work in my thesis.

If you'd like to chat or would just like more information, please do not hesistate to contact me by email or on LinkedIn.
